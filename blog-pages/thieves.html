Back in 1960’s, while people like<b> Steve Jobs and Bill Gates</b> were not in the market, there was a company called <b>Xerox</b> which created the first <b>Copy machine</b> in <u>1959</u>. The company was reaping around <b>half a billion dollars</b> every year in copier machines but eventually their <b>patent got expired</b> and it led to the allowance of many cheaper brands into the market. Those cheaper brands <b>challenged the Xerox Company</b>.</p>

<b>Xerox Company Management</b> decided to move into a new technology to tackle the situation. They approached <b>Jack Goldman</b>, an ambitious man and their

In <u>1969</u>, Jack Goldman opened Xerox <b>Palo Alto Research Center</b> [PARC]. PARC had the most inspiring and innovation team.</p><br>

 <p>You would not believe me; they had been in large part responsible for developments such as:<br><b>
• Laser Printing<br>
• Ethernet<br>
• Personal Computer<br>
• Graphical User Interface<br>
• Desktop Paradigm<br>
• Object Oriented Programming<br>
• Ubiquitous Computing<br>
• Electronic Paper<br>
• Amorphous Silicon Applications<br>
• Mouse<br>
• VSLI for semiconductors<br><br></b>
</p><p>
PARC had all these technologies in their <b>lab</b> but know that PARC was under a Private Corporate Management called <b>XEROX which wasn’t interested</b> in these technologies. They were fully focused on their <b>Successful Line of Copiers</b>. When the management doesn’t care about PARC, PARC also didn’t care about their management and continued their inventions and they decided to <b>incorporate all their inventions</b> and they created a computer called the <b><u>Xerox Alto</u> </b>which had <b>Keyboard and Mouse interfaces</b>, they also featured <b>E-mail, Word Processing and even Remainders</b>. The Managers at Xerox didn’t even care about the Computer which would cost around <b>$40,000 per piece</b>. For namesake, Xerox funded for the production <b>2,000 machines and never went into commercial lane.</b>

                      It seemed that Managers at Xerox were only interested in Copier Machines and they never showed interest in Xerox Alto. Researchers at PARC eventually lost their will to work with Xerox and they <b>left the company to start their companies or join the many rising Tech Companies</b>. Even though Xerox Company didn’t show their interest, PARC made a name among the Tech People.

                    <p>Steve Jobs realized that PARC was the Future and he <b>sold 100,000 shares of Apple to Xerox</b> but Xerox management still stayed wiser and showed no interest.

                  <p>At the same time, Microsoft was working with Apple as the first third part software developer for Macintosh. Like Apple, Microsoft also snatched lot of PARC Employees. <b>Bill Gates was also well aware of the Xerox Alto </b>and its innovations but Steve Jobs was aware that Gates would act.</p>

                    Since Jobs was aware, he made <b>Gates to sign an agreement in 1981</b>. Due to the agreement, Microsoft was unable to release mouse-based software till 1983. However, Apple’s Lawyer had forgotten to account for their potential of project delays. Macintosh release date was pushed back to 1984 but the contract remained the same which brought<b> a great advantage and a turning point for Microsoft</b>. Bill Gates made a surprise announcement about <b>Windows,an GUI Platform</b> which made Jobs upset which made him to file a suit which obviously doesn’t stand longer.

                    When Steve Jobs confronted Gates and accused him. Gates made this statement:

                  <blockquote class="margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                <p><b>“I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the set and found out that you had already stolen it”</b></p>

                <p>
PARC was open about its inventions. Steve Jobs biopics even show that <b>Xerox Alto was openly demonstrated to over 2,000 people in 1975</b>. So, it gives a conclusion that Xerox may have created the <b>GUI and Personal Computer</b> but they didn’t manage to bring their invention to commercial area. No one here is a thief, people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are ambitious man with great courage, they both believed that they could bring a Change and they did.</p>

                  <p>
                    In today's world, many things changed.PARC was transformed in 2002 into an independent, wholly owned subsidiary company dedicated to developing and maturing advances in science and business concepts with the support of commercial partners and clients.<br><br>
PARC's current work is centered around a series of Focus Areas which include:<b><br># Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Machine Collaboration; <br># Digital Workplace;<br># Novel Printing;<br># Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Intelligence;<br># Digital Design and Manufacturing; <br># Microsystems and Smart Devices.</b><br><br> Xerox Corporation stays the same and still leads the printing market with its latest Xerox Exclusive Concurrent Multi-tasking Technology. We should be grateful to the Xerox Company which took the Computing experience to the next level.
