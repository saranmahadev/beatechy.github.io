                 <p>
                  I am a <b>Tech Enthusiast</b> and I am also an college where I have to analyze all the <b>Future Technologies</b> to choose my career. When I started to analyze about Artificial Intelligence, I was pretty shocked, and have to mention that Iron man was my hero in my childhood, so It is a fantasy to have an AI like Jarvis. In the Current world, we reached nothing to go near Jarvis but there are <b>advancements in AI </b>which are pretty amazing, but it is all applied Intelligence to the machines. You may be confused now, when you finish this blog you will have a pretty good idea about AI and you will be about explain about AI to many people.

                                   <h1>Know Some AI <span class="main-color">Basics</span></h1></div>  
                                   <p>
                                    In Today’s world, AI is like a fancy thing which most of them are attracted to learn and it is perfect field to go today but first understand some basic things before entering AI.

                                    <b>AI is a technique that enables machines to mimic human behavior and for adapting to human behaviour which is trained using neural networks.</b><br><br></p><p>
<u>Neural network</u> is a name many people who are in tech field would have heard but many may not. Let me explain you about neural networks in a very strange way. You and me are human beings who always make mistakes. So, let us consider a mistake, you went into a car and when you closed the door without noticing that your other hand is on the closing area, you will get hurt. After that incident you will not close the door until your hands are away from the closing area. So, what happed here? You learnt from your mistakes and you changed yourself according to the desired results. <br><br>
Let’s explain this process more in a technical way.<br>
<b>• You Entered a Car which is the Input<br>
• You got hurt which is the output<br>
• Brain alters itself to check your hand whenever you enter a car again<br><br> </b>
<div class="col-sm-6 custom-pad-2">
                                     <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/09/08/19/07/a-2729794__340.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                                  </div>
                                </p>
                                <p>
Neural Networks also works in the same way as the brain does, you give an input into a neural network and it gives an output and the output will get a feedback which may be positive or negative. If the feedback is negative then the neural networks alters itself and runs the process again and again until it gets a positive feedback which is obviously called as Machine Learning. Deep Neural Networks are applied to run unsupervised learning tasks which leads to the development of Super Intelligence AI.<b> Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</b> are two differnt topics,It is not necessary to learn Machine Learning first to learn Artificial Intelligence. If you are interested in Machine Learning, you can directly start with ML. If you are interested in implementing Computer vision and Natural Language Processing applications, you can directly start with AI.<br><br>   
I think this Blog is getting more technical and above things are actually some must know basics before entering AI. Let me get into the three popular questions that are not properly answered about AI and then discuss about career in AI which will bring end to this blog. <br><br>
</p>
                   <div class="post-title margin-bottom-10">
                                   <h1>When will <span class="main-color">Jarvis</span> come into existence?</h1></div>  
                                   <p>
                                   It’s a pretty interesting question. Even AI experts can’t answer this question. Many people saw the demonstration by the <b>Sundar Pichai [CEO of Google]</b> where the <u>Google Assistant calls the Salon and Hotel to make a reservation </u>, if you didn’t watch video, Please Watch It know.<br><br><br></p>
                                  <a class="video-popup" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsK0GD6Z144" >
                                    <div class="post-image">
                                   <img src="images/ai-01.jpg" alt="">
                                   </div>
                                   </a><br><br><br>
                                   <p>
                                    After watching the video, many people were excited and people started to think that <b>Jarvis and Ultron are going to come into existence</b>. I think Google played very well with their goal to make believe the people that Google Assistant is a real AI which is actually not. This may be a controversial answer but it is the real thing that happened over that stage. I didn’t say that Google was faking that, Google did create a neural network, who knows it may be even trained with deep learning algorithms but the neural network applied there is nothing but a good comparing and searching algorithm. Google has more than billions of conversations to search and compare with same questions and answers. Google Assistant uses it voice recognition and gets to know the question and compares with its billions of conversations it has, and answers perfectly to the given question.<br><br>

                                     Let me tell you it is not <b>Super Intelligence AI</b>. A Super Intelligence AI is exactly like human being which should learn itself and answer to questions. When you were born you were not loaded with billions of conversations to compare with. You first learned the language then you make mistakes and you correct yourself till your life ends. An AI is considered to a Super Intelligence AI when it learns every second to alter itself according to the conditions, situations, etc. So, coming back to the question, Jarvis will come to life when you form a baby machine with enoromous but it should learn itself to become a man.<br><br> You’ll never know when will that AI will be created. Maybe when you are reading this blog, it may be created or it can take decade or years or it may never be found.    </p>

                       <div class="post-title margin-bottom-10">
                                   <h1>Will AI <span class="main-color">Rule us Or Kill Us</span> ?</h1></div>  
                                   <p>
                                     Science fiction movies always showed the people that AI would take us. Unfortunately, there is a <b>great possibility</b>. Please Read these lines which was take from Wikipedia</p>
<div class="about-author">
                                    
                                    
                                   
                                    <div class="c-padding">
                                       <p>
                                      
<b>Physicist Stephen Hawking</b>, Microsoft founder <b>Bill Gates</b> and SpaceX founder <b>Elon Musk</b> have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that <b>humans could not control it</b>, with Hawking theorizing that this could <q>spell the end of the human race</q>.<br><br> Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that <q><b>Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.</b> </q> <br><br>Hawking also believed that in the coming decades, AI could offer <u>"incalculable benefits and risks"</u> such as <b>"technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand."</b> </p>
</div>
                                    </div><br><br>
                                    <p>

So, believe me there is a<b> maximum possibility</b>. I also want to share my point of view here. So, consider this, when you create a machine with Human values and give access to all our history and everything. Our Human History are garbage enough to provoke a simple good human. When an AI learns the entire history of Humans, I believe there would 95% of chance that AI would take its step to annihilate us.

                                   In today’s world, believe me<b> AI may displace some jobs</b> but on the other hand with AI, many new jobs are created. Jobs will shift and evolve, not disappear. 
Today’s Developed AI, they are not enough complex to alternate itself for all the conditions. <b>Innovation and Invention</b> are the both which can only be done the human beings not by an AI. Acting according to situation which can’t never be done by AI,know that Today's AI are just machines which are trained with enormous data. </p>

  <b>Future is always unpredictable</b>. My Uncle <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasikar-nagarajan-35066852/">Vasikar Nagarajan</a> [ Senior manager at<b> Cognizant Technology Solution who is having 20 years of IT experience </b>] told me that when he started working in IT, there would be<b> technology shift for every 5 years</b>, but now-a-days there is a technology shift for every <b>2 years</b>. So IT world is moving faster every year. So, people should start to adapt to new technology and explore new jobs. AI may evolve any day; all we have to do is be ready to adapt ourselves to the new technologies arising.

                            <p style="text-align: left;">Many People in the world are working with Artifical Intelligence in various Sectors. AI is a sound career choice. We may not achieved Super Intelligence but we managed to create many bots and virtual assistants which is dynamic enough to alter itself. AI is also used in many other fields like Stock Management, Sports Analytics, Self Driving Cars, Auto Correction and Detection of mistakes in various sectors, etc. So AI  may be a right path to go. It is <b>all your mindset</b>. According to LinkedIn 2020 Emerging Career Report, AI Specialist stands first and don't worry about your salary, an average AI programmer makes $100,000 to $150,000 [According To Datamotion.com].</p>
