                                 <p>The pandemic is worsening more and more and people are staying at home and using the internet to work and socialise. Millions across the world switch to working from home. They may be putting the security and privacy of themselves ,their families and their employers at risk. The findings showed that the rapid changes to enterprise working practices are being exploited by cybercriminals as they step up their attacks. They are also working in stressful conditions that could leave them more likely to forget routine security procedures and fall victim to phishing and spam attacks.</p>

                                    <p>According to <b>WHO</b>, Pandemic is <q><b>a world wide spread of new disease</b></q>
 This pandemic situation made us to stay in home. And the severe part of this pandemic is all forms industries faced lot of troubles in their working activities. Nearly all the IT firms and few other technical industries, started their daily work from their home itself. <br><br>
This forced them to rely on cyberspace. So, in this situation cyberspace widened its wings to a great extend.
Due to this wide spread of virtual space, most organisation have seen a rise in security threats and attacks during “COVID-19” pandemic.    <br><br>
 For many people, working remotely from home is a completely new experience. Some are celebrating the novelty by using the #WorkFromHome hastag on social media,and sharing posts that include photos of home office setups, friends and family members. This may actually expose a variety of sensitive data about you and those around you. Likewise in this essay we will see many cyber attacks targeted on the people in this pandemic situation.

                                    <p>In this COVID-19 pandemic ,the number of cyber attacks dramatically increased most specifically email scams targeting the public at large.<br><br>
We all know that WHO is the official organisation to release official information and awareness to world wide public. But now the scammers have made various sites and pages with fake name and they act as official page and collect sensitive data and sometimes amount too. <br><br>WHO reported that 
Scammers impersonating WHO in emails have increasingly targeted the general public in order to channel donations to a fictitious fund and it has been found that they are not authentic COVID-19 Solidary Response Fund.
After some incidents, WHO is now migrating affected systems to a more secure authentication system.

                                    <p>Phishing attack is stealing sensitive information by tricking people to open an email, messages containing malicious links or attachments. This was mostly targeted on the school & college students who attends online classes timingly due to the shutdown of instituitions for past 4 months. The students may click on unwanted links and attachments while searching for resources. 
                                     <h2> MACRO VIRUSES ATTACK:</h2>
Recently In Mongolia Attackers aimed public sector employees. Which resulted in large scale data theft. It involved an email and word document about the prevalence of new corona virus infections, pretending to be from the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The email and document look authentic and provide relevant information. After opening the file installs a malicious code on the victim’s computer that runs every time they open their word processing application.
This malicious code allowed the attacker to remotely access their device and inject more malicious code, instruction or upload software on the victims device. From this type of attack , the attacker can spy on the affected machine, using it to steal sensitive data, can get transation details, or direct further attacks.<br><br>
<h2>PRIVACY ISSUES:</h2>
Due to lockdown, many people will be using online collaboration tools such as zoom, google meet, google classroom, jio meet, etc to stay connected to colleages and friends. <br><br>
Zoom,the most popular video calling platform that allows call hosts to track attendee attention. Zoom also collects a host of other personal information such as each caller’s location data ,operating system, IP Address, and what kind of device they are using.<br><br>
Zoom app has some bugs too. There was also a problem with its software which could have resulted in any malicious website turning on attendees’ camera and mic.<br><br><br>


<h2>MALWARE ATTACKS:</h2>
There are a ton of fake zoom apps around, which are actually dangerous  malware. These fake apps runs malicious code after installed inside our systems and devices and take control over the data. <br><br>
If you do have to use the app, we should be aware and always go to the official site to download the app or Google Play store or Apple App store for mobile devices.<br><br>
<h2>REMEDIES:</h2>
There are some precautions to avoid proning  to cyber attacks. Here are few awaring tips:<br><br>
• The organisation  need to ensure the security and protect themselves with a holistic ,end to end security architechture.<br>
• Implement multi-factor authentication to reduce the impersonation of official organisation.<br>
• Protect your devices  by installing anti-virus software, update system and apps. <br>
• Be carful what you post publicly. Check that there is no potentially sensitive information in it.<br>
• Share  meeting links with only invited parties. <br>
• The private sectors must establish more robust internal systems and strengthen security measures and they should educate staffs on cyber security risks.<br><br><br>

The public should remain vigilant against fraudulent emails and recommends the use of reliable sources to obtain information about the issues. Thus we can create secured cyberspace in this situation.<br>
