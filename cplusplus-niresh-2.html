                         <h2>What is OOPs(Object -Oriented Programming)</h2>
                                  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language which is organized by objects rather than
actions and data. An object-oriented programming characterized by data controlling access to code of OOPS.<br> C++ supports the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOPs)<br><br>

                        Object<br>
                        Class<br>
                        Inheritance<br>
                        Polymorphism<br>
                        Abstraction<br>
                        Encapsulation<br>

                    <h2>CLASS</h2>
Simply class is defined as the collection of object, it doesn’t take any space memory like an object. It consists of data members and methods. The main function of class is to hold data. The member function determines the behavior of the class.
Here you can make a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.

<h2>INHERITANCE </h2><br>
      Defined as the procedure or mechanism of acquiring all the properties and behavior of one class to another. Simply it can be explained as the properties and behavior of child class from the parent class.<br>
      That is a one object can takes and process all the properties and behavior of another one. And it provides reusability and establishes relationship between different class. A class which inherits the property is known as child class(sub class or derived class). The class which s responsible for carrying its properties is known as parent class(Super class or base class).

<h2>POLYMORPHISM<h4>(one interface-multiple implementations)</h4></h2><br>
       A a certain task can be done through in different methodical ways I.e. polymorphism. In another way it can be defined as it has the ability to create a property, a function, or an object that has more than one realization. <br>
       It has the ability to substitute classes that have common functionality in sense of methods and data. In polymorphism, the member function with same name are defined in base class and also in each derived class. It also used tp keep the interface of base class to its derived classes.<br>
       Polymorphism can be achieved by means of virtual functions.<br>
Polymorphism is classified into two ways:<br>
  <h3> Method Overloading (compile time polymorphism)   </h3><br>
        It is a features to allows a class to have two or more methods having the same name but the arguments passed to the 
Methods are different. Compiling time of polymorphism refers to a process in which a call to an overload method is resolved at compile time rather than at run time
   <h3>Methods Overriding(Run Time Polymorphism)</h3><br>
         If sub-class(child class) has the same methods as declared in the parent class, it is called as method overriding. If subclass provides the provides the specific implementation of the method that has been provided by one off its parent class, it is known as method overriding.
<h2>ABSTRACTION</h2>
         It is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. For an example if you use a computer it provides only the output but it doesn’t shows the the internal processing.which means you only see the output you don’t know the  internal processing.
<h2>ENCAPSULATION(Information hiding)</h2>
          It is used to combine data members and functions is called as a class. This is used to prevent then data to access directly.the access is provide to them only the class. Encapsulation is one of the familiar features in Object-Oriented programming in the concept of data hiding.
           So, it is also called as information hiding.

<h2>OBJECT-ORIENTED CONCEPT  </h2>

                    <h2>Advantages of OOPs</h2> <br>
      It offers several major advantages to software development:<br><br>
I.   Reduced susceptibility to errors<br>
II.  Easy re-use<br>
III. Low maintenance requirement<br>
